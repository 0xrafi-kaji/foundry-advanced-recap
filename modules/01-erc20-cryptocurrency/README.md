**Where can i get these ?**

>> New Improvement Proposals and Requests for Comments are tracked on websites such as ```eips.ethereum.org```, where you can watch these proposals go through the process real time and be adopted or rejected by the community.

## ERC20
One of the most recognized ```Ethereum Requests for Comments``` is the ERC20 Token Standard. This is a proposal in which the methodology for creating and managing these tokens on the Ethereum blockchain was tabled.

These tokens essentially exists as records of value within smart contracts on chain and this smart contract tracking of balances is a very powerful thing in Web3.

### Why make an ERC20?

There are a few common reasons that someone may choose to launch an ERC20 token, but there's very little limit to the possibilities of their application in a digital space. A few common use cases include:

- Governance Tokens
- Securing an underlying network
- Synthetic Assets
- Stable Coins
- Nft & gaming
- ICO/IDO
- DeFi
- Cross-chain (bridging)
