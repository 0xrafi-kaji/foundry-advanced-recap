# 02 Nft Collection

Notes for this module.

## What is a NFT?
Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a product of the ```ERC721 Token Standard```, created on Ethereum.

NFTs are:

  - Non-fungible: This means they are explicitly unique from one another and one NFT cannot be interchanged with another

Fungible tokens, like ERC20s are similar to a dollar. Any single dollar can be swapped with any other and no value is lost. NFTs by contrast are unique in themselves with different properties from token to token

>>❗PROTIP
>>
>> Think of NFTs like Pokemon! No two Pikachus are exactly the same and there are many different types within the same class or collection. Other comparisons include: trading cards, unique pieces of art

## What's an NFT do?
Because of their unique nature, NFTs have been widely adopted as a medium for art and a means to trade and collect digital art. Sometimes this gets a bad rap, but NFTs are only a standard on which a tonne of use case functionality can be built. Some protocol turn them into representations of game assets, or into tradable metaverse items, sometimes they're used as means to keep record, or grant access to services or events.

The use cases of NFTs grow each day, but the easiest way to think of them currently is as unique digital assets, or unique digital art.

## ERC721 Standard (NFTs)
NFTs, and the ERC721 Token Standard, differ from ERC20s in a few fundamental ways.

**Ownership**

ERC20s handle ownership via a simple mapping of a uint256 token balance to an address.

ERC721s, by contrast, each have a unique tokenId, these tokenIds are mapped to a user's address. In addition to a tokenId, ERC721s include a tokenUri, essentially a tokenUri details the unique properties of that token, stats, images etc.

>> What makes an NFT unique?

>> The uniqueness of an NFT token is demonstrated by it's unique tokenId as well as it's metadata/tokenUri. This is a property of an NFT which details the attributes of that token. You can imagine a character in a game, the tokenUri would be their stats page and all the details that make them an individual.

### TokenURI
TokenURI stands for Token Uniform Resource Identifier. At its core it serves as an endpoint that returns the metadata for a given NFT.

**Example TokenURI Metadata Schema:**
```
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        }
    }
}
```
